# ========================================
# CONFIGURATION NOTES
# ========================================
#
# AGGRESSIVE vs CONSERVATIVE:
# - Risk per trade: 0.6% (vs 0.08% conservative)
# - Portfolio heat: 3% (vs 0.8% conservative)
# - Pump score: 75+ (vs 90+ conservative)
# - RVOL: 2.0x (vs 3.0x conservative)
# - Max hold: 2h (vs 3h conservative)
# - Scan interval: 2min (vs 3min conservative)
#
# PROTECTIONS IN PLACE:
# - Daily loss limit: 3% (stops trading after -3% day)
# - Max concurrent: 3 positions (prevents over-exposure)
# - Tighter ATR stops: 1.3x trailing (faster exits)
# - Portfolio heat cap: 3% total risk
# - USDT-margined MEXC perps only (no cross, no spot)
#
# EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
# - 2-3x more pump signals per week
# - Faster entries (2min scans)
# - Faster exits (20min trail start, 2h max hold)
# - Higher win rate from more opportunities
# - Protected by multiple safety layers
